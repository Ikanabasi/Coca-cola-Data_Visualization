# Coca-cola Data_Visualization

In this project, i took on the work of an Excel Analyst and visualized Coca-cola data from key American retailers.
I added filters like Region, Retailer and Beverage brand as this would help the Coca-cola company gain insights on the Total sales, Total units sold, Total operating profit and Average operating margin.

According to the data, more sales where made in the west and lesser sales in the midwest.
